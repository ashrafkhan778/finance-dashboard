# Project Components

# 1.Data Acquisition
The project begins with the acquisition of raw sales data. This data may include information such as customer orders, product details, order dates, and transaction amounts. Data can be obtained from various sources, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

# Insights and Recommendations

1 .Income is higher than expenses year-to-date.
The largest expense category is rent, followed by cruises and vacations.
Here are some recommendations based on the insights from the dashboard:

2 .The user may want to consider setting a savings goal.
The user could track their spending more closely to see if there are any areas where they can cut back.
The user may want to invest some of their savings in order to grow their wealth over time.
It is important to note that these are just general recommendations, and the best course of action will vary depending on the user's individual financial situation and goals.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The dashboard does not show any information about the user's debts or liabilities.
The dashboard does not show any information about the user's investment portfolio.
The dashboard only shows data up to June 20, 2024.
